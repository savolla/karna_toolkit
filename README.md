# Karna Toolkit
My personal `shell assistant`. It's like Alexa or Siri but for command line. And she is called **Karna**. When I struggle on some topic I usually look for solutions in [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) or [Server Fault](https://serverfault.com/)server fault. Why not just store those solutions into small functions that can be runned later?
